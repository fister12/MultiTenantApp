# 🔧 Migration Fix Applied

## What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Database provider mismatch
- Old migrations were for SQLite (`provider = "sqlite"`)
- New database is PostgreSQL (`provider = "postgresql"`)
- Prisma couldn't apply SQLite migrations to PostgreSQL

**Solution Applied**:
1. ✅ Removed old SQLite migration files
2. ✅ Created fresh PostgreSQL migration
3. ✅ Updated migration lock to PostgreSQL
4. ✅ Enhanced build script with fallback options

## Changes Made

### Files Updated:
- `prisma/migrations/migration_lock.toml` → Changed to PostgreSQL
- `prisma/migrations/20250914000000_init_postgresql/migration.sql` → New PostgreSQL migration
- `scripts/vercel-build.js` → Added migration fallback logic

### Migration Strategy:
1. **Primary**: Try `prisma migrate deploy` (uses migration files)
2. **Fallback**: Use `prisma db push` (direct schema sync)

## Expected Deployment Result

The next deployment should show:
```
✅ Prisma client generated successfully
🗄️ Setting up database schema...
✅ Database migrations deployed successfully
🌱 Seeding database...
🏗️ Building Next.js application...
✅ Build completed successfully!
```

## Verification Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Check health endpoint: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health`
2. Test login with: `admin@acme.test` / `password`
3. Verify database seeding worked

The deployment should now work correctly with PostgreSQL!
